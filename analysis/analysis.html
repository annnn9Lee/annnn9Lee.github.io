				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>
					In the opening paragraph [Sec #1], the last sentence points out the plan to protect Arctic sea ice. It mentions the method <q>to scatter a thin layer of reflective glass powder</q> and the purpose <q>protect it from the Sun’s rays and help ice grow back.</q> So the highlighted sentence is the thesis statement.
				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					<q>
						As planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, some have been driven to explore desperate measures. One proposal put forward by the California-based non-profit Arctic Ice Project appears as daring as it is bizarre: <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">to scatter a thin layer of reflective glass powder over parts of the Arctic, in an effort to protect it from the Sun’s rays and help ice grow back.</span>

					</li>
					<p>The key phrase <q>rising sea levels</q> is the statement of the impact of the melting ice, and scientists worry that <q>geoengineering</q> will <q>cause further damage</q> to the ecosystem.</p>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a> - Field uses silicon to reflect the sunlight and the project has save the ice from melting.</b><br/>
					</li>
					<p>The word <q>silicon</q> states the material used in the saving of melting ice, and the phrase <q>encouraging results</q> indicates the success of the project.</p>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec4">[Sec. #4]</a> - Scientists consider the act is out of well-intention, but some worry about the glass beads may affect the ecosystem.</b><br/>
					</li>
					<p>The statements of the worry of the glass beads are that the beads <q>could block sunlight from photosynthesising plankton</q>, and the beads may be <q>eaten by zooplankton</q>.</p>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec5">[Sec. #5]</a> - The geoengineering plan cannot replace reducing carbon emission.</b><br/>
					</li>
					<p>Why geoengineering is not a replacement is that geoengineering <q>only treat single symptoms</q>.</p>

				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p>
					In the last paragraph, the author quotes Field’s words. Field agrees that geoengineering cannot solve the climate change issue once and for all, and it is <q>in no way a replacement for reducing carbon emissions.</q> <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">The need to reduce carbon emissions is still urgent, and the geogineering  is a way can buy more time for people to reduce carbon emissions.</span>
				</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>Researchers are exploring the feasibility of other geoengineering approaches to save the melting Arctic, but none come without problems. One, for instance, would entail building millions of wind-powered devices to pump water from the deep to the ice surface in order to build up thicker layers of ice – which is energy-intensive and might not be very effective, Bitz says. She and Serreze view such approaches as stop-gap solutions to climate change, in that they only treat single symptoms – in the case of silica dust, temperatures – while doing nothing about the root cause of it. If Field’s strategy works as intended, “that’s wonderful,” Bitz says, “but I know that not emitting CO2 in the first place will work.” Field agrees that geoengineering is in no way a replacement for reducing carbon emissions. Rather, she sees it as a chance to buy the time needed for world economies to decarbonise and stave off the worst impacts of climate change. The silica beads, she says, are “the backup plan I hoped we’d never need.”</q></p>
