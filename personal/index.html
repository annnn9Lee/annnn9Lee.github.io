				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>
					Hello! I’m Pei-Yi Lee, or Angel. I am a sophomore in National Tsing Hua University majoring in foreign language and literature. Lately I start to learn Japanese, because I have a strong interest of it. I was born and raised in Hsinchu City. People say that Hsinchu is a “food desert,” well though I want to say something about it, I actually don’t know many restaurants selling cheap and delicious delicacies.

					In my free time, I watch videos on YouTube or listen to music, mostly J-Pop songs. I like to watch anime, and I sometimes draw charaters from anime, but right now I am too busy to do that, also I’m running out of ideas. I wish I could have more time to do so. I like singing very much, so I joined the glee club back in junior high and senior high. I can forget the worries and relax when singing, so that is why I enjoy it.
