				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! I’m Pei-Yi Lee, or Angel. I am a sophomore in National Tsing Hua University majoring in foreign language and literature. I was born and raised in Hsinchu City. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time, I watch videos on YouTube, sometimes I draw some random stuff. I write some fanfictions , but right now I am too busy to do that also I’m running out of ideas. It’s embarrassing to show my works so I won’t put the link here. :P
					I like singing very much, so I joined the glee club back in junior high and senior high. I can forget the worries and relax when singing, so that is why I enjoy it.
