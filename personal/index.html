				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! I’m Pei-Yi Lee, or Angel. I am a sophomore in National Tsing Hua University majoring in foreign language and literature. Lately I start to learn Japanese, because I have a strong interest of it. I was born and raised in Hsinchu City. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time, I watch videos on YouTube, sometimes I draw some random stuff. I like to watch anime, and I wrote some fanfictions of anime before, but right now I am too busy to do that, also I’m running out of ideas. I wish I have time to write more.
					I like singing very much, so I joined the glee club back in junior high and senior high. I can forget the worries and relax when singing, so that is why I enjoy it.

				<h2>關於我</h2>
				<p>
					大家好，我是李珮誼，英文名字是Angel。現在是個就讀清華大學外國語文學系二年級的學生。我出生和成長都是在新竹市。 
				</p>
				<p>
					空閒的時候我喜歡隨意畫一些圖和在YouTube上看影片。我喜歡動漫畫，也有寫過一些關於某些動漫作品的二次創作小說。但是現在沒有梗也沒有時間寫了，希望以後有空可以再寫。
